### What are the key benefits of DevOps and how can we utilise them? (provide use cases or exmaples)

- DevOps helps improve cost effectiveness as it leads to faster deployment of live builds, reducing development costs. Additionally it also ensure higher quality code, reducing the chance of failures during development.
- The continous development practices that DevOps incorporate allows the organisation to react faster to change in tools or the market
- Increased ease of use by having automated tests, making tests easy to run whenever changes are made.
- Increase robustness by using regression and confirmation testing to ensure the application works and is of a high quality.


### What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud? (use cases)

- The public cloud is the internet based service that a company can pay a fee to store information on (data stored on the public cloud should be non-confidentional information)
- The private cloud is onsite infrastructure used to store data at an organisations owned premises 
- The hybrid cloud is an app using a combination of both the public and private cloud to use data, using the public cloud for publiclicy available data and the private cloud for more sensitive data.

### What is Monolith Architecture, 2 tier and Micro-services Architecture? (use cases and benefits)

- Monolith architecture combines all sections of the application (Front, back and the database) into 1 package, and works best for small applications as modifications to any part of the application effects the whole system

- 2 tier architecture is seperating the front end of the application from the backend and the database which are kept together. This works better for medium sized applications.

- Microservices seperate all the different services of an application to keep them as independant as possible to changes to one module has minimal effect on others, this is best for larger scale applications.
